# JavaScript Pokedex
Your very own PokÃ©dex! Written using JavaScript and plain CSS.
<br />
This was my first 'toy' project, and something I like to add to every once in a while...
<br />
<br />
This project taught me about many things, including DOM manipulation and the fetch API, as well as creating and editing SVGs.
<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy having a play!
